Jekyll [themes distributed as Ruby gems](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) are finally here to make installing and upgrading much easier. Gone are the days of forking a repo just to "install it". Or dealing with merge conflicts when pulling in upstream commits to "upgrade it".

If you're interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:

1. Support for a theme `assets` folder was recently [added to Jekyll core](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5364), but has yet to be released or rolled into the `github-pages` gem. Meaning you can't use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet... locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don't mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll. 
2. Windows users can't currently use themes packaged as gems due to a [bug with file paths](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5192) in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a [fix is on the way](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5256) soon.

Fine with all that? Great. Let's continue.

If you're migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven't customized any of the `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass` partials, or `assets` this should be quick and painless.
